# Github Game Off

Made for Git-Hub Game-Off 2024

Welcome to Secret Hand, the card game where the rules are a secret!

Inspired by frustrated Midwest relatives, in secret hand, you are challenged to a game of cards with your loving grandfather. Only problem? You have no clue what the rules are. Use intuition, trial and error, and clues in the game world to figure out how to play this strange game and take down your venerable elder who has played this game for more hours than you've been alive. 

This is the first game I've released so any feedback is appreciated. 

I used the asset pack PaperCards by uncookedtoast on Itch.io

-------- RULES --------

Note: The following rules are intended to be discovered in game. This guide is recommended for people who have played the game but are still confused.


Each round, the player has 9 cards. They must select and play 5 cards to be scored. The cards that are not played remain in the player's hand and they are dealt 5 more cards at the end of the round.

Flipped card: The flipped card is the card next to the game board each round. This card serves 2 purposes, it determines what type of hand is a secret hand and how many points each hand is worth.

The pot: The pot is what this game calls the value of the flipped card. This is used for determining how many points hands are worth. Aces are 1, facecards are 10, and all other cards are equal to their number value.

---Scoring---

After the player plays a hand, the 5 cards played will be scored. If a player scores more than the opponent, their score is added to the total. If the hand is a draw, nobody gets points.

The strength of hands is as follows:
1. Secret Hand
2. 3 of a Kind
3. 2 Pair

2 pair: If a player plays 2 pair (hand includes 2 pairs of the same number value (e.g. [2, 2, 6, 6, 8])), the hand scores the value of the pot + 3 (e.g. if the flipped card is a 6, the hand scores 8)

3 of a Kind: If a player plays a 3 of a kind (hand includes 3 cards with the same number value (e.g. [3, 3, 3, 5, 8])), the hand scores the value of the pot + 3 (eg if the flipped card is a 6, the hand scores 9)

Secret Hand: The secret hand is a hand that corresponds to the suit of the flipped card. The secret hand is always worth 15 points, regardless of the pot. The hands are as follows:

Flipped card is a:
- Club: Full house (hand includes a 3 of a kind and a pair (e.g. [3, 3, 3, 2, 2]))
- Diamond: Straight (every card in the hand is in consecutive order (e.g. [8, 9, 10, J, Q]))
- Heart: Flush (every card in hand is the same suit (e.g. all cards are clubs)
- Spade: One of the cards in your hand must be the same number as the flipped card (e.g. if the flipped card is a jack, your hand must include a jack)
