# Github Game Off

Made for Git-Hub Game-Off 2024

Welcome to Secret Hand, the card game where the rules are a secret!

Inspired by frustrated Midwest relatives, in secret hand, you are challenged to a game of cards with your loving grandfather. Only problem? You have no clue what the rules are. Use intuition, trial and error, and clues in the game world to figure out how to play this strange game and take down your venerable elder who has played this game for more hours than you've been alive. 

This is the first game I've released so any feedback is appreciated. 

I used the asset pack PaperCards by uncookedtoast on Itch.io
